## 5.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter begins the "second half" of linear algebra. 

The first half was about Ax = b. The new problem Ax = λx  will still be solved by simplifying a matrix -- making it diagonal if possible. 

*c step is no longer to subtract a multiple of one row from another*. Elimination changes the eigenvalues, which we don't want.

Determinants give a transition from Ax = b to Ax = λx. In both cases the determinant leads to a "formal solution": to Cramer's rule for x = A⁻¹b, and to the polynomial det (A - λI), whose roots will be the eigenvalues. (All matrices are now square; the eigenvalues of a rectangular matrix make no more sense than its determinant.) The determinant can actually be used if n = 2 or 3. For large n, computing λ, is more difficult than solving Ax = b.

The first step is to understand how eigenvalues can be useful. One of their applications is to ordinary differential equations. We shall not assume that the reader is an expert on differential equations ! If you can differentiate xⁿ, sin x, and eˣ, you know enough. As a specific example, consider the coupled pair of equations

```
dv/dt = 4v - 5w,  v = 8 at t=0,
dw/dt = 2v - 3w,  w = 5 at t=0.		(1)
```

This is an ***initial-value problem***. The unknown is specified at time t = 0 by the given initial values 8 and 5. The problem is to find v(t) and w(t) for later times t > 0. 

It is easy to write the system in matrix form. Let the unknown vector be u(t), with initial value u(0). The coefficient matrix is A:

```
Vector unknown :

u(t) = ⎡v(t)⎤, u(0) = ⎡8⎤,  A = ⎡4 -5⎤
	   ⎣w(t)⎦		  ⎣5⎦		⎣2 -3⎦
```

The two coupled equations become the vector equation we want:

```
Matrix form :

du/dt = Au    with u = u(0) at t=0  (2)
```

This is the basic statement of the problem. Note that it is a first-order equation -- no higher derivatives appear -- and it is *linear* in the unknowns. It also has *constant coefficients*; the matrix A is independent of time.

How do we find u(t)? If there were only one unknown instead of two, that question
would be easy to answer. We would have a scalar instead of a vector equation:

```
Single equation :

du/dt = au   with  u = u(0) at t=0	(3)
```

The solution to this equation is the one thing you need to know:

```
Pure exponential 	u(t) = eᵅᵗu(0)	(4)
```

At the initial time t = 0, u equals u(0) because e⁰ = 1. The derivative of eᵅᵗ has the required factor *a*, so that du/dt = au. Thus the initial condition and the equation are both satisfied.

We shall take a direct approach to systems, and look for solutions with the *same exponential dependence* on *t* just found in the scalar case:

 - v(t) = e<sup>λ</sup>ᵗy

 - w(t) = e<sup>λ</sup>ᵗz &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)

or in vector notation:

 - u(t) = e<sup>λ</sup>ᵗx. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)

This is the whole key to differential equations du/dt = Au:  ***Look for pure exponential solutions***. Substituting v = e<sup>λ</sup>ᵗy and w = e<sup>λ</sup>ᵗz into the equation, we find
