 - Properties
    - Any two parallel lines have the same vanishing point
    - The ray from C through v point is parallel to the lines
    - An image may have more than one vanishing point

 - Multiple Vanishing Points
    - Any set of parallel lines on the plane define a vanishing point
    - The union of all of these vanishing points is the horizon line
        - also called vanishing line
    - Note that different planes define different vanishing lines
 

 - Applicaiton
    - Comparing heights
    - Measuring height
