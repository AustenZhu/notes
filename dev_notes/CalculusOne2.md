## What is a Sequence?

 - 1,1,2,3,5,8,...
 - a₁,a₂,a₃,a₄,a₅,a₆,...
 - a₆=8, a₃=2
 - we use (a<sub>n</sub>) represents the whole sequence

---

 - "arithmetic progression"
    - a sequence with a common difference between the terms. 
    - 5,12,19,26,33,... 
        - a<sub>n</sub> = a₀+d<sub>n</sub>
    - Why are these things even called arithmetic progressions? 
        - Each term Is the arithmetic mean of its neighbors. 
        - 12 == (5+19)/2
