## Virtual Machine Abstraction


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/imgs/os_vm_abstraction.png)

 - Software Engineering Problem:
    - Turn hardware/software quirks => what programmers want/need
    - Optimize for convenience, utilization, security, reliability, etc…
 - For Any OS area (e.g. file systems, virtual memory, networking, scheduling):
    - What’s the hardware interface? (physical reality)
    - What’s the application interface? (nicer abstraction)

## Protecting Processes from Each Other

 - Problem: Run multiple applications in such a way that they are protected from one another
 - Goal:
    - Keep User Programs from Crashing OS
    - Keep User Programs from Crashing each other
    - [Keep Parts of OS from crashing other parts?]
 - (Some of the required) Mechanisms:
    - Address Translation
    - Dual Mode Operation
 - Simple Policy:
    - Programs are not allowed to read/write memory of other Programs or of Operating System 


## Address Translation

 - Address Space
    - A group of memory addresses usable by something 
    - Each program (process) and kernel has potentially different address spaces.
 - Address Translation:
    - Translate from Virtual Addresses (emitted by CPU) into Physical Addresses (of memory)
    - Mapping often performed in Hardware by Memory Management Unit (MMU)
